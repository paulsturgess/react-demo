# A React Demo app

This app exists to allow me to demo [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for a dev talk

It was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

[The original Readme is well worth a read](README-CREATE-REACT-APP,md)

## Commands

Boot it up via:

```
$ npm start
```

Run the tests via:

```
$ npm test
```

Check test coverage via:

```
$ npm test -- --coverage
```
