Install node (nodejs.org)
npm – npm is like rubygems but for javascript dependencies
Now there is Yarn but ignore that for now.

create-react-app
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
```
npm install -g create-react-app

This creates the dev dependency react-scripts
Which is: Babel, ESLint, and Webpack + config + a bunch of scripts

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
```

Live reloading

public/index.html
Entry point for the js is... index.js
Talk about router

Show HelloWorld component
- Use import to include functions, classes, components etc.
- A component has a render method which returns the markup
- render function is what it returns
- extend Component from 'react'

Show Clock component
Props – essentially an object you can pass into a component.
State - is local to the component. A component doesn't have to use state.
State can be passed onto child components and those will be re-rendered if the
state changes. It's top-down, only effects components below them in the tree.
JSX – largely like html except you enclose javascript inside {}

Show UI component
Components can have child components
e.g. the UI component contains the Navigation so it always remains on screen.
The UI component could include the page layout.

Show Navigation component

The entry point
A single render that returns your components
and specifies the element in the html that react can hook into.
Show public/index.html


- use export to allow your component to be included elsewhere

React router

Navigation is a stateless functional component

Tests
Create React App uses Jest but you can use jasmine
